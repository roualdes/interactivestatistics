# interactivestatistics
A collection of interactive statistics visualizations.

The following visualizations will work simply by obtaining the HTML
file and opening in a modern browser.

- conditional_probability.html
- point_tooltip.html

All other visualizations (if any) are developed on a locally hosted
server and probably won't work by just opening the HTML file in a
browser.
