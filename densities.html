        <p>
          Density functions play a prominent role in applied
          statistics, despite only existing in certain scenarios.  For
          now, we'll ignore these special cases and focus on gaining
          an understanding of density functions themselves, instead of
          the greater context surrounding density functions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The easiest way to think about density functions is as
          functions with a small set of properties.  The properties
          that make an ordinary function \( f \) defined on a space \(
          S \) a density function are <span class="marginnote">I use
          the phrase density function to refer to both probability
          mass functions and probability density functions.</span>

          <ol>
            <li> \( f \) is real-valued, \( f : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \),
            <li> \( f \) is non-negative, for any \( x \in S \), \( f(x) \geq 0 \), and </li>
            <li> the area under the function is equal to one, \( \int_{S} f = 1 \).
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          I intentionally leave out the \( dx \) for a number of
          reasons.  First, the meaning of \( dx \) is not obvious, see
          the Section "Meaning of the symbol \( dx \)" on Wikipedia's
          page on
          the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral#Meaning_of_the_symbol_dx">Integral</a>
          or <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/analysis-on-manifolds">Munkres'
          "Analysis on Manifolds."</a> Second, and more practically
          important for us, that integral absuses some more advanced
          notation <span class="marginnote">Check out the Section
          General Distribution Functions in Kyle Siegrist's OER

          says, when the space \( S \) is countable, the integral
          becomes a sum, and when that space \( S \) is uncountable
          the integral is really an integral.

            These lecture notes first introduce the two most common
            structures of sample spaces for density functions,
            discrete and continous.  Some examples follow, where we
            describe a handful of scenarios where specific density
            functions are employed.  The density functions highlighted
            all come from well known and named distributions.  Last,
            we explore some properties of density functions.

              The third property above depends on the structure of the
              space \( S \).  When \( S \) is a countable set, say \(
              \mathbb{N} \), we have

              \[ \sum_{x \in S} f(x) = 1. \]
          </p>

          <p>
              Let's try a simple example.  Consider a possibly unfair
              coin, where we denote heads as one and tails as zero, so
              that \( S =
              \{0, 1\} \).  In this case, we'd call \( f \) the density
              function of a Bernoulli distribution <span
              class="marginnote">Check out my lecture notes on the
              family of <a href="notes/bernoulli.html">Bernoulli
              distributions</a>.</span> with parameter \( p \)
              and has the following form

              \[ f(x | p) = p^x (1 - p) ^{1 - x}. \]
          </p>

          <p>
              You should verify that all three properties
              above are met with the density function \( f(x | p) \)
              defined for arbitrary \( p \in (0, 1) \).
          </p>

          <p>
              A unique feature of density functions on countable spaces
              is that probabilities of points are equal to the density
              function evaluated at that point, \( \mathbb{P}[\{x\}] =
              f(x) \).  This property is not true for density
              functions defined on uncountable spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 id="continous">Continuous Sample Spaces</h2>

          <p>
              When \( S \) is an uncountable space, say \( \mathbb{R}
              \), we have

              \[ \int_S f(x) dx. \]
          </p>

          <p>
              Let's try an example. Consider the family of Exponential
              Distributions, defined on \( S = \mathbb{R}^+ \), where
              the density function depends on the population parameter
              \( \lambda \in \mathbb{R}^+ \) and has the form

              \[ f(x | \lambda) = \lambda \exp{(-\lambda x)}. \]
          </p>

          <p>
              You should verify that all three properties above are
              met with the density function \( f(x | \lambda) \)
              defined for arbitrary \( \lambda \in \mathbb{R}^+ \).

              Density functions are the basic building blocks of
              applied statisticians.<span class="marginnote">Density
              functions are closely associated with named
              distribution functions.  All the examples below will
              highlight density function which come from a named
              distribution.</span>  Their basic structure helps
              statisticians model the stochastic world with some
              relatively simple tricks.

          <p>
              <b>Bernoulli Distribution</b>.  The family of Bernoulli
              distributions have a key characteristic that makes
              identifying when to use the density function of a
              Bernoulli distribution more obvious than most other
              distributions.  The sample space \( S \) for a Bernoulli
              distribution has exactly two elements, which are often
              taken to be \( \{0, 1\} \) no matter what values the
              real world process produces.  So long as there's only
              two outcomes, label the one that is more interesting one
              and the other zero.
          </p>

          <p>
              The classic example for a Bernoulli distribution is a
              coin.  The Bernoullid distribution has a single parameter \(
              p \), which statisticians to model the world by estimating
              \( p \) from data.  Because the parameter \( p \) can be any
              value in \( (0, 1) \), the density function of a Bernoulli
              distribution is often used in more realistic scenarios. The
              US presidential elections are often modeled with a Bernoulli
              density function.
          </p>

          <p>
              For a third example, imagine that you are interested in
              testing a specific version of your web-browser.  You
              randomly sample \( 1000 \) web-pages and load them on
              your browser.  If a particular page loads correctly,
              label it one.  If a particular page does not load
              correctly, label it zero.  These \( 1000 \) data points
              consisting of ones and zeros are called observations.
              The data theoretically came from a Bernoulli
              distribuiton with a value of \( p \) that is unknown.
